# Contributing to Fantasy Tavern Cashflow

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Fantasy Tavern Cashflow as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable.
2. Update the package.json version following [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer.

## Code Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Keep commits atomic and focused

## Commit Message Guidelines
